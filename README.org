WIP bluesky client for Emacs

** Terrible usage instructions

Currently out of date, won't update today

*** Setup 
1. Evaluate all the buffers because this isn't even a functional package yet
2. Log in using =(bsky-authenticate)=

When your access token expires, you can use =(bsky-refresh-authentication)= to refresh using the refresh token.

*** Posting

The function =(bsky-ui--create-post-buffer)= will create a new buffer for your post, write your text below the comment.

Calling =(bsky-ui--post-bsky-post-buffer)= while in the buffer will make a post to bluesky.

Up to four images linked through org file links (\[[file\:file.png]\]) or the first org http(s) link embedded in the post, in that order. Only either images or the link can be embedded.

The link embed metadata is generated by the client, not the server. You can specify the title and the description in the org link name, like this:

#+begin_src
[[https://example.com]][[Title:::Description]]
#+end_src

This would result in an embed that looks like this.

[[file:assets/link.png]]

Thumbnails are not supported (yet?).

Quote posts also don't exist yet.

**** Reply

Calling =(bsky-ui--create-reply)= in an org element with the uri and cid attributes set correctly should generate a post buffer, that has attributes for a parent and root post.

Posting this buffer should make a reply, embeds work as usual.

** Viewing posts

The function =(bsky-ui--show-posts)= creates org elements for a list of posts.

The function =(bsky-api--search)= can be used to search for posts, check the function itself for the possible parameters.

** TODOs

Make some kind minor mode to lightly enforce only posting in post buffers
Add a character count to the info bar?

** Plans?

Posts and their replies should be represented as org headings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
 * post
 ** post
 ** post
 ** post
 * post
#+end_src

This should allow for easy collapsing of posts. I am not sure about how I would represent different reply chains, ideally I would just create custom ui for everything but I kind of like the idea of just relying on org-mode.

The heading name being post is definitely a placeholder, maybe I should put the author name there?
